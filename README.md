# 3-in-1-Game
Snake, Flappy Bird, and Tic Tac Toe
3 in 1 Game is a Java-based project that combines three classic games: Snake, Flappy Bird, and Tic Tac Toe. The project provides a simple user interface where players can choose any of the three games from a single panel and play them individually. Each game features basic gameplay mechanics using Java Swing and Java AWT libraries to create an interactive graphical interface.
